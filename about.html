                <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hello! My name is Michael Wilcox, I was born an raised in Washington State, USA, and I love technology, fish keeping, and the great outdoors!</p>
            <p>I consider myself to be a pretty open minded person who is willing to learn new things on a daily basis as well as try to teach someone something new whenever the opportunity arises. As such, I have lots of various hobbies that keep me pretty busy when I am not at work or working around my 5 acre property. My hobbies include, but are most definitely not limited to, fish keeping, chainsaw carving, digital photography and pc gaming (because console gaming just isn't as challenging).</p>

                <h3>Fish Keeping</h3>
                <p>Tropical fish have always fascinated me, but the real fun for me is in the aquascaping. In my opinion, nothing brings an aquarium to life more than a fully functional environment for the fish to live in. Live plants, real woods and rocks mixed with a community of tropical fish makes for a tank that is both peaceful to listen to and fun to stare at for hours! Not to mention, the possiblities of arrangments are endless.</p>

                <h3>Chainsaw Carving</h3>
                <p>I began chainsaw carving in mid 2019 out of shear boredom. I had just finished cutting up firewood for the day and decided to take my chainsaw and carve on a stump that was about 14 inches tall. I made my first mushroom! Since then, I have made benches, signs, bears, sea creatures, and much more!</p>

                <p>There is so much more that I could type about here, but instead, if you want to know more about me, you can <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> and simply ask. I'm a pretty open book!</p>
